                <h2>Water... is it really good for you?</h2>
                <p>Could the liquid humans have been consuming since the beginning of time be a hoax? Sources say that
                    water might actually not give any health benefits at all. The staff at Salutem
                    Healthcare is currently recommending that all individuals substitute water for an ice cold Fresca.

                <p>Salutem Healthcare just ordered over one-million containers of essential oils from all over the
                    globe. According to the experts, essential oils are a safe and better alternative for anti-biotics.
