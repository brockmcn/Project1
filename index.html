                <h2>Water... is it really good for you?</h2>
                <p>Could the liquid humans have been consuming since the beginning of time be a hoax? Sources say that
                    water might actually not give any health benefits at all. The staff at Civsalu
                    Healthcare is currently recommending that all individuals substitute water for an ice cold Fresca.

                <h2>Civsalu Healthcare on essential oils</h2>
                <p>Civsalu Healthcare just ordered over one-million containers of essential oils from all over the
                    globe. According to the experts, essential oils are a safe and better alternative for
                    anti-biotics.
                    There are few people who would argue that a possible pyramid scheme could make for the best
                    medicine.

                <h2>Civsalu staff giving back</h2>
                <p>Civsalu Healthcare staff members visited a local elementary school last Tuesday. The staff members
                    arrived equipped with AEDs and the students begun CPR training by practicing on each other. For you
                    families at home with little ones, you never know when they could save a life!
