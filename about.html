            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our mission here at Civsalu is to provide a medical service like no other. By having a hospital that
                requires no medical degree, we allow for more medical services than any other hospital. Funding is also
                more available because of the little amount we have to pay our staff. Here at Civsalu, the equipment
                comes first and the doctor comes second.</p>
            <h3>History of Civsalu</h3>
            <p>Civsalu was founded in 1996 by Dr. Mantis Tobogan. Dr. Tobogan was in a terrible car accident as a kid
                and needed immediate medical attention. Unfortunately, his family could not afford the price of a doctor
                with a fancy P.H.D. After never recovering from a serious head injury, Dr. Tobogan vowed that day he
                would create a hospital where anyone could treat anyone. This concreted that their would never be a
                shortage of doctors to help those in need. Civsalu has been helping a wide range of patients since, and
                boasts a mortality rate of under 60% (statistic taken from broken arm injuries).</p>
