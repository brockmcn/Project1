    <h1>Project 1 Report</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business, a
            student group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be
            just you.</li>
        <p>The client I chose was a mde up hospital company that is run by ordinary citizens.</p>

        <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided
            you adhere to their license.</li>
        <p>I created my own icon (the top left image) and all images were taken from pixabay.com with commericial free
            licenses.</p>

        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files
            should be named index.html, which Apache loads by default.</li>
        <p>The home page is named index.html. I have 5 pages: index, staff, services, portal, and about.</p>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of header.</li>
        <p>Each page has a Civsalu Healthcare header and every secondary page (non-index) has a secondary header
            informing the user of the page they are currently on.</p>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
        <p>Each page has a nav bar at the top and the services page has navigation links to search by letter.</p>

        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance,
            multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.</li>
        <p>Each page includes media support. Examples of things that change are the nav bar turns into a menu button and
            all multi column layouts change to single column layouts. The about page external links, the service page
            list of services, the staff page portraits, and the portal page inputs. The index page also has the caption
            take up the entire image, rather than just half.</p>

        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared
            stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate stylesheets.</li>
        <p>style.css and secondary-page.css all contain shared styles. For example, each page uses the same header and
            footer which is described in style.css. Each secondary page has secondary headers, which is describe in
            secondary-page.css.</p>

        <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users
            of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</li>
        <p>Each image comes with an alt attribute, for example the alt attribute for each image in about is the same as
            it's figcaption.</p>

        <li>Each page must declare its favicon.</li>
        <p>I created my own icon which is present at the top of each page (the cross icon at the top left).</p>

        <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS
            files must be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.</li>
        <p>I have 3 folders: css, images, and js. Each folder has their respective files in them, with all html files in
            the main directory.</p>

        <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular,
            Vue, or any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party
            tools.</li>
        <p>No third party libraries or frameworks have been used.</p>

        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu
            Validator.</li>
        <p>All pages have been validated without ay warnings or errors using the W3C's Nu Validator.</p>

        <li>The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and
            right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.</li>
        <p>Most content is aligned neatly through the use of grids or flexboxes. For example, each portrait in the staff
            page is neatly aligned in a gallery fashion using a flex box with wrap.</p>

        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and
            paragraph copy in a serif font.</li>
        <p>As shown in the style.css file, content in the header is sans-serif whereas content in the main is serif.
            There are also a few unique fonts here and their, like the company slogan at the top of each page.</p>

        <li>Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit
            data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not
            specified.</li>
        <p>The portal page comes with a form you can "submit." Submitting this form invokes a client-side JavaScript
            function that alters the page by animating the form off the screen and showing a "submission received" box.
        </p>

        <li>Your site must include links to external sites.</li>
        <p>The about page contains 3 links to external sites under the "Current Engagements" section to direct users to
            serious awareness causes should they be interested.</p>

        <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
            classes and IDs.</li>
        <p>All code has been formatted and meaningful names have been used for classes and IDs (containers are called
            containers, forms are called forms, etc...).</p>

        <li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.</li>
        <p>My site includes multiple animations, for example the portal page has animations on the labels in the input
            boxes and when you properly submit the form.</p>

        <li>Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab,
            and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.</li>
        <p>My site is stored in a Git repository and is shared with my instructor.</p>

        <li>The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.</li>
        <p>Each file is entirely lowercase and only contains alphabetic characters (except for secondary-page.css which
            contains a hyphen, but that is within naming convention guidelines).</p>

        <li>Your site must have its own domain name.</li>
        <p>My site has it's own domain name "project1.brock347.me"</p>

        <li>Your site must be served out over HTTPS on port 443. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a
            free certificate.</li>
        <p>My siute is served out over HTTPS on port 443.</p>

        <li>Users who access your site over HTTP on port 80 must be automatically redirected to port 443.</li>
        <p>Users are properly redirected to port 443.</p>

        <li>Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and
            pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.</li>
        <p>I have been commiting to the Git repository steadily through the course of a couple of weeks.</p>
    </ol>
